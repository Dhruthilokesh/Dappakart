# Transparent Supply Chain Verification System

## Project Overview

Dappakart is a blockchain-based e-commerce platform inspired by Amazon, developed to showcase the transformative potential of Web3 in creating transparent, trustless, and decentralized marketplaces. Our enhanced version is aimed at solving real-world supply chain challenges by integrating a sustainability-focused verification mechanism.

### Inspiration

Traditional e-commerce platforms are often:

* Prone to counterfeit products
* Controlled by centralized authorities
* Lacking transparency in the origin and delivery of goods

We aim to build a system that:

* Validates product authenticity
* Removes intermediaries
* Enables ethical and secure trade using blockchain

## Core Idea

Our platform enables users to buy and sell products using cryptocurrency. Each transaction is governed by smart contracts to enforce rules automatically, and product details (such as origin, brand, and sustainability claims) are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

##  Key Features

###  Decentralized Marketplace

* Peer-to-peer platform for buying and selling
* Eliminates middlemen and reduces transaction fees

###  Cryptocurrency Payments

* Accepts payments in Ethereum (ETH), MATIC, USDT, and other ERC-20 tokens

###  Smart Contract Integration

* Handles escrow, order verification, and settlements automatically
* Reduces fraud and chargebacks

###  Transparent Supply Chain

* Immutable records of each product’s journey
* Sustainability and compliance details viewable by customers

###  Public Ledger & Verification

* All transactions publicly verifiable
* Buyers can trace fund flow; sellers can validate authenticity

###  Trustless System

* No third party required to verify or process transactions
* Ethereum enforces the rules through smart contracts

##  Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite.js
* **Blockchain**: Solidity, Ethereum (Rinkeby/Polygon testnet)
* **Smart Contracts**: Hardhat
* **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect
* **Backend**: Node.js (optional for APIs)
* **Database**: Hardcoded the product metadata in smart contract
##  Challenges Faced

*  Balancing privacy vs. transparency
*  Regional regulations on cryptocurrency payments
*  Writing and testing robust smart contracts
